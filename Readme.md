# Pandoc-PDF converter script

A simple bash script to batch convert markdown files to PDF files using Pandoc.

## Usage

Simply copy the conv.sh to the directory containing the markdown files and execute it. The script will create an output directory and prompt the user to choose a LaTeX engine. If new files are added the script can be re-run and only new files will be compiled.
